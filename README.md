Title: **Calculation and machine learning prediction of molecular spectra**

Student: Adnan Jasarevic

Advisor: Dr Hande Toffoli

Goals:
- developing neural networks and other ML tools to predict the NEXAFS spectrum from the coordinates of a molecule,
- preparing the machinery to calculate the NEXAFS spectra of the molecules in QM9 database,
- using a classification tool to assign the characters of the peaks.
